https://github.com/KennyHazlett/April_2022


The Project is a database of dreams.
Users can register and login.
Users can view edit and delete their own dreams.
Users can view other users dreams.
I am attempting to do some additional work by adding a comment feature.
The comment feature will be in a specified record of a dream
After submitting the comment, the user will be directed to a page of comments
consisting of all comments made in regards to that specific dream.
Any user can see those comments and any user can add comments.
I have had an idea where it would be neat to add an anonymous feature so if
a user felt like they wouldn't want to share their name, they could in fact 
keep it anonymous but I am not sure how to go about that just yet.

All of the check marked items will be included in the project.

Bonus feature will be bootstrap or another bonus feature that I have not
made my mind up about yet because I don't know how it is done as of yet.
